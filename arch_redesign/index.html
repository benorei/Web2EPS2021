                <h1>A simple, lightweight distribution</h1>
                <p class="hero-main">You've reached the website for Arch Linux, a lightweight and flexible Linux®
                    distribution that tries to
                    Keep It Simple.</p>
                <p>Currently we have official packages optimized for the x86-64 architecture. We complement our
                    official package sets with a community-operated package repository that grows in size and quality
                    each and every day.</p>
                <p>Our strong community is diverse and helpful, and we pride ourselves on the range of skillsets and
                    uses for Arch that stem from it. Please check out our forums and mailing lists to get your feet wet.
                    Also glance through our wiki if you want to learn more about Arch.</p>
                <p><b>Arch Linux is an independently developed, x86-64 general purpose GNU/Linux distribution versatile
                    enough to suit any role.</b> Development focuses on simplicity, minimalism, and code elegance. Arch is
                    installed as a minimal base system, configured by the user upon which their own ideal environment is
                    assembled by installing only what is required or desired for their unique purposes. GUI
                    configuration utilities are not officially provided, and most system configuration is performed from
                    the shell by editing simple text files. Arch strives to stay bleeding edge, and typically offers the
                    latest stable versions of most software.</p>
                <p>Arch Linux uses its own Pacman package manager, which couples simple binary packages with an
                    easy-to-use package build system. This allows users to easily manage and customize packages ranging
                    from official Arch software to the user's own personal packages to packages from 3rd party sources.
                    The repository system also allows users to easily build and maintain their own custom build scripts,
                    packages, and repositories, encouraging community growth and contribution.</p>
                <p>The minimal Arch base package set resides in the streamlined [core] repository. In addition, the
                    official [extra], [community], and [testing] repositories provide several thousand high-quality
                    packages to meet your software demands. Arch also offers the Arch Linux User Repository (AUR), which
                    contains more than 49,000 build scripts, for compiling installable packages from source using the
                    Arch Linux makepkg application.</p>
                <p>
                    Arch Linux uses a "rolling release" system which allows one-time installation and perpetual software
                    upgrades. It is not generally necessary to reinstall or upgrade your Arch Linux system from one
                    "version" to the next. By issuing one command, an Arch system is kept up-to-date and on the bleeding
                    edge.</p>
                <p>Arch strives to keep its packages as close to the original upstream software as possible. Patches
                    are applied only when necessary to ensure an application compiles and runs correctly with the other
                    packages installed on an up-to-date Arch system.</p>

                <p>To summarize: Arch Linux is a versatile, and simple distribution designed to fit the needs of the
                    competent Linux® user. It is both powerful and easy to manage, making it an ideal distro for servers
                    and workstations. Take it in any direction you like. If you share this vision of what a GNU/Linux
                    distribution should be, then you are welcomed and encouraged to use it freely, get involved, and
                    contribute to the community.</p>

            <h4 class="em">linux-firmware 20220119.0c6a7b3-2 requires kernel >=5.3 and package splitting</h4>
            <p>
                The linux-firmware package 20220119.0c6a7b3-2 implements kernel firmware compression. Linux kernel from
                5.3 on support loading from xz compressed firmware.
                CONFIG_FW_LOADER_COMPRESS kernel option must be enabled. All official Arch Linux kernel support this for
                a long time. [1]
                The linux-firmware package has been split into smaller packages to further reduce required disk space.
                Some big firmware files of rarely used hardware have been split into separate packages.
                This affects firmware for Mellanox Spectrum switches, Marvell devices, Qualcomm SoCs, Cavium LiquidIO
                server adapters, QLogic devices, Broadcom NetXtreme II 10Gb ethernet adapters.
                Make sure to install additional firmware packages if needed. [2]

            <h4>ibxml2>=2.9.12-6 update may require manual intervention</h4>
            <p>

                The libxml2 package prior to version 2.9.12-6 was missing the compiled python modules. This has been
                fixed in 2.9.12-6, so the upgrade may need to overwrite any untracked pyc files created. If you get
                errors like these

                libxml2: /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/__pycache__/drv_libxml2.cpython-310.opt-1.pyc exists in
                filesystem
                libxml2: /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/__pycache__/drv_libxml2.cpython-310.pyc exists in filesystem
                libxml2: /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/__pycache__/libxml2.cpython-310.opt-1.pyc exists in
                filesystem
                libxml2: /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/__pycache__/libxml2.cpython-310.pyc exists in filesystem

                when updating, use

                pacman -Syu --overwrite /usr/lib/python3.10/site-packages/__pycache__/\*

                to perform the upgrade.

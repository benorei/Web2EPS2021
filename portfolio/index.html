                    I promise to impress with my design, functionality, and user experience. I'm always looking for new

                    I've been a web developer for 9 years. I've worked with a variety of technologies, from HTML, CSS,
                    and
                    JavaScript to PHP, MySQL, and even Java backends. I've been interested in programming since I was
                    young
                    and I've always had a passion for creating.

                <h2>Modern design for a modern age</h2>
                I design with all the features a website should have in 2022, such as automatic dark mode and mobile optimization, both of which are available to test on this website.

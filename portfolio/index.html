                    I've been a web developer for 9 years. I've worked with a variety of technologies, from HTML, CSS,
                    and
                    JavaScript to PHP, MySQL, and even Java backends. I've been interested in programming since I was
                    young
                    and I've always had a passion for creating.

                optimization, both of which are available to test on this website.

                <p>
                    I was tasked with creating a new website for a client. I worked with two other developers to design
                    and construct this website. Its prominent features are a global navbar, JavaScript sort mechanic,
                    and a responsive design.

                <p>
                    For this project, I decided to explore the idea of "What if my robotics team was a robotics product
                    company?" I created a website that would showcase the fictional company's products.
